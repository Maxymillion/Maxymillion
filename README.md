<p align="center"><strong>Who?</strong> That question may take a lifetime to find out.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>What?</strong> Lately I've been working on getting my note setup to the next level, for which I am using <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>. I've been missing a few features, so I am building quite a few plugins to make my life even easier! I'll post my setup some day, as my collegues have been praising (and using) it.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Where?</strong> I've redirected <a href="https://www.maxymillion.com">Maxymillion.com</a> to my Github profile for the time being, until I (at some point) create a website.</p>
